	    <p>NAP only collects personal information that is voluntarily provided such as through Online Leasing, napLife and by contacting NAP by email or online form with questions, comments or inquiries. Personal information includes things such as social security number, email, phone number, address or personal financial information such as credit card numbers.

	    <p>NAP may contact customers to provide leasing information or other related data.

	    <h4>Information NAP Provides to Third Parties</h4>
	    <p>NAP will not share customer's personal information collected online or off-line with any third party for direct marketing purposes.

NAP may also disclose personal information if it has a good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order, legal process or legal request.</p>
	    <h4>Sale of Company Assets</h4>
	    <p>The compilation of information collected through NAP's site is considered a trade secret of NAP's.

Although NAP does not currently anticipate such an event, changes to this Privacy Statement might result from changes in NAP corporate status.</p>
